## About Me

Hey there! I'm **Zsolt Varjú**, a passionate web enthusiast hailing from Čierna Voda, Slovakia. My journey into the digital world began as a Web Page Tester, where I worked closely with frontend developers. This experience ignited my passion for frontend development, leading me to dive deep into React, Next.js, and headless CMSs. With a master’s degree from Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, I'm eager to transform design files into seamless, functional, and visually stunning user experiences.

Currently, I’m honing my skills while actively transitioning into a frontend developer role. Outside of coding, you’ll find me running, skiing, or exploring the fascinating realms of 3D printing and microPCs like Arduino. I also love to dabble in 3D modeling whenever time permits.

I’m on the lookout for a **frontend developer position** where I can combine my technical expertise with my passion for creating exceptional web designs. As Seneca wisely said, "Luck is when preparation meets opportunity," and I feel prepared—just waiting for the right opportunity to come along.

If you think we might be a good fit, let’s connect! You can check out my work, projects, and connect with me through the following links:
